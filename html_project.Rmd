##Introduction

Apprehensions at the US-Mexico border have declined to near-historic lows over the last few years. The objective of this report is to give a deeper insight on this change that has been occuring. Through the analysis of the data collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the years, we intend to shed light on the general trend's behaviour of this phenomenon, focusing on how factors such as time and place have influenced the given outcome.


## Descriptive Data Analysis on sectors and months

  # to update whenever input$obs changes (only when the user clicks
  # the action button)
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    
    # draw the chosen year bar plot with the specified sector
    dataset <- datasetInput()
    barplot(dataset[,input$sector], 
            main=paste(input$sector, "Apprehensions in", input$dataset),
            las=2,
            ylab="Number of People")

##On sectors and months:
From 2010 to 2017, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection saw an overall 36 percent decrease in apprehensions for illegal entry to the country. The plots show a significant different trend of monthly apprehension changes between the two years. Sectors also exhibit different patterns of changes from each other. The effects of both time and sector on apprehension distribution can be examined by the following 𝜒2 tests:

1)  Chi-squared test on the 2010 apprehensions by months and sectors.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
chisq.test(ap10)
```

2)  Chi-squared test on the 2017 apprehensions by months and sectors.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
chisq.test(ap17)
```

Both tests suggest that time and sector have significant impact on apprehension changes. 


```{r ByMonth, echo=FALSE}

barplot(CmbColS,
        beside=TRUE, 
        las=2, 
        main = "Apprehensions by month",
        cex.lab =1.5,
        col = c("orange","red") )
legend("topright",
       c("Apprehensions in 2010","Apprehensions in 2017"),
       cex=0.8,
       bty="n",
       fill=c("orange","red") )


```
In fact, the biggest difference between 2010 and 2017 distribution come from January through June. The most tracated months in 2010, such as March, April and May are also the ones with the biggest decline in 2017. A possible explanation of this decline is related to the change of Presidency in the US. With Trump administration laying out tightened immigration policy, it is likely that more immigrants hesitate to enter the country, legally or illegally. Similarly, looking by sector, Tuscon exhibits the biggest difference in apprehension between 2010 and 2017. Despite having the most apprehensions in the 2010, Tuscon experienced a decline over 80% in 2017. On the other hand, Rio Grande Valley, which contributed the most apprehensions in 2017, experienced dramatically increased from Sep to Oct. 
While some sectors experience increases in apprehension from 2010 to 2017, the steep decline in Tucson overpowers those rises and leads to the overall decline in the country’s apprehensions.

```{r BySector, echo=FALSE}

barplot(CmbRowS,
        beside=TRUE, 
        las=2, main = "Apprehensions by sector", 
        cex.lab =1.5, 
        col = c("orange","red") )

legend("topleft",
          c("Apprehensions in 2010","Apprehensions in 2017"),
          cex=0.8,
          bty="n",
          fill=c("orange","red") )

```

The tests below examine the changes in Tuscon and in Rio Grande Valley, one with the maximum apprehension in 2010 and the other in 2017.

 1) T-test on Tucson observations.
 

```{r, echo=FALSE}


by_sector.t(8)


```
 

 2) T-test on Rio Grande Valley observations.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}


by_sector.t(6)


```

The above test highlights the changes between 2010 and 2017 within Tuscon and Rio Grande Valley. The Tuscon sector played a critical role in the change of apprehensions between the two years whereas the changes in Rio Grande Valley are less significant.

Now, let’s look at how distribution changes in the months with the maximum traffic in each year. 

3) T-test on the three most trafficated months in 2010: March, April, May


```{r, echo=FALSE}


  t.test(as.numeric(xb10), as.numeric(xb17), paired = TRUE)


```

4) T-test on the three most trafficated months in 2017:  October, November and December.


```{r, echo=FALSE}


  t.test(as.numeric(xa10), as.numeric(xa17), paired = TRUE)


```

##Analysis of changes over years
The time series plot shows that from 2000, there has been continuous decline, from a high of over 1.6 million in 2000 to around 300,000 in 2017. Over these years, US policies on immigration control have been rapidly developed, leading to potential correlation with the change in apprehensions.
In addition to the overall decline, seasonal fluctuation is another noticeable trend in the plots. The apprehensions tend to decrease during the winter months. A reasonable explanation is that harsh weather decreases attempts of illegal entry while keeping other factors controlled. These fluctuations, however, remain the same pattern over the years, despite the overall declining trend. The seasonal effects cause the changes among months, but plays little role in the rapid changes among years.


```{r TimeSeries1, echo=FALSE}
#Time series calculations

ts3 <- ts(as.vector(unlist(t(msum))),frequency = 12, start=c(2000,1))

ts.plot(ts3,main="Time Series from 2010 to 2017", gpars=list(xlab="year", ylab="Apprehensions", lty=c(1:3)))

#create data for calculating the annual means and draw the means line
ts3.1<-as.vector(t(msum))

for (i in 1:18 ){
  if (i == 1){
    from <- i
    to <- 12
    annualMeans <- c(mean(ts3.1[from :to]))
  }  
  else{
    from <- 1 + to
    to <- i*12
  }  
  annualMean<- mean(ts3.1[from: to])
  #print(annualMean)
  annualMeans <- append(annualMeans, annualMean)
  segments(1999+i,annualMean,2000+i,annualMean, col = rgb( 0, .7, .9, .5),lwd=2)
}

annualMeans <- annualMeans[-1]  

text(0.5+seq(from = 2000, to = 2017, by = 1),annualMeans[1:18]+6000,labels=2000:2017, cex=0.7, col = rgb(.9,  0, .7, .5) , font=2)
## add legend
legend('topright', col=c(rgb(0,0,0),  rgb( 0, .7, .9, .5)), lty=1, lwd=2, 
       legend=c("Monthly apprehensions", "Annual averages"), bg='white')


# Box plot across months will give us a sense on seasonal effect 
boxplot(ts3~cycle(ts3), main="Distribution of Monthly Apprehensions",xlab="month", ylab="Apprehensions")


```




We can see that there are months that have witnessed a consistent change in apprehensions during the years (January, February, March, April), while others tended to stick up around a more limited range of values such as October, November, December. Moreover, the first months of the year seem to have been the most trafficated ones over all. 

```{r TimeSeries2, echo=FALSE}

#  forecast
fit <- arima(ts3, order=c(1,0,0), list(order=c(2,1,0), period=12))
fore <- predict(fit, n.ahead=24)
#  error bounds at 95% confidence level
U <- fore$pred + 2*fore$se
L <- fore$pred - 2*fore$se
ts.plot(ts3, fore$pred, U, L, col=c(1,2,4,4), lty = c(1,1,2,2), main="Projection", xlab="month", ylab="Apprehensions")
legend("topleft", c("Actual", "Forecast", "Error Bounds (95% Confidence)"), col=c(1,2,4), lty=c(1,1,2))
# Decompostion of additive time series
timeseriescomponents <- decompose(ts3)
#timeseriescomponents
plot(timeseriescomponents)



```




##Conclusion
The significant decline of border apprehensions since 2000 mainly come from changes in specific sectors, such as Rio Grande Valley, and time of a year, such as March to May. More research on political and economical factors can be done to further explain the causes.
